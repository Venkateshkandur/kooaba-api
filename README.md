# kooaba Web Services

The kooaba Web Services offer access to [kooaba](http://www.kooaba.com)'s image recognition platform. The Web Services consist of API's for recognition of query images (Query API) and for uploading reference images to the databases for recognition (Data API).

## Obtaining API access

Access to the API can be obtained via [http://www.kooaba.com/en/developers/query_api](http://www.kooaba.com/en/developers/query_api).


## Using the API

Once you obtained your access keys, documentation on using the API's and some sample code are given in the subdirectories of this project.

Read more about the [Query API](query_api/README.md).
